# PlanetScale Terraform Provider

Work in progress Terraform provider for PlanetScale.

Not ready for general consumption.

## Docs?

ðŸ‘‰ [Docs!](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/planetscale/planetscale/latest/docs)

## Usage

To use this provider, include the following blocks in your Terraform code:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    planetscale = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/planetscale/planetscale"
    }
  }
}
```

You must then configure the provider to either use a service token, or an access token. Either can be configured in the provider config block, or via env vars (`PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_NAME` and `PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN`, or `PLANETSCALE_ACCESS_TOKEN`):

```hcl
provider "planetscale" {
  # use a service token
  service_token_name = "..." # ID of the service token to use, e.g "8fbddg0zlq0r"
  service_token      = "..." # Secret for the service token.

  # or use an access token
  access_token       = "..." # Secret for the access token.
}
```

## Known limitations

- Support for deployments, deploy queues, deploy requests and reverts is not implemented at this time. If you have a use case for it, please let us know in the repository issues.
- When using service tokens (recommended), ensure the token has the `create_databases` organization-level permission. This allows terraform to create new databases and automatically grants the token all other permissions on the databases created by the token.

## Contributing

Note that this provider builds on top of the OpenAPI part of the PlanetScale API. The client used by this project is currently different from the Client provided in `planetscale-go`, and is largely code-generated from the OpenAPI schema found at https://api.planetscale.com/v1/openapi-spec. This schema is first [vendored](openapi/openapi-spec.json), then [lightly transformed](internal/cmd/extractref) using [custom config rules](openapi/extract-ref-cfg.json) into [its final form](openapi-spec.json), and then used to [generate](internal/cmd/client_codegen) the [client code](internal/client/planetscale).

Contributions should follow this workflow, or integrate with it.

### Tests

You will need to set either `PLANETSCALE_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN_NAME` and `PLANETSCALE_SERVICE_TOKEN` to run acceptance tests.

The org to create resources under is currently hardcoded in the tests. You may need to change this to match your own org.  Acceptance tests create real resources in your PlanetScale org.

Run all tests: `make testacc`

Run specific test: `make testacc TESTARGS='-run ^TestAccBranchResource$'`

Debug logs: `TF_PS_PROVIDER_DEBUG=1 TF_LOG=debug make testacc` (or `TF_LOG=trace`)

From time to time it may be necessary to manually cleanup databases created by the acceptance tests. Running `make sweep` will delete all db's created by the acceptance tests older than 24 hours. Alternatively you may run `AGE_SECS=900 make sweep` to supply a shorter age threshold.
